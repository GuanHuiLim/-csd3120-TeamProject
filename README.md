## 🗡️Try It Now!

The Project is hosted on [itch.io](http://itch.io) for you to try! Grab your VR headset and experience it yourself [here](https://coltcustom.itch.io/webxr-game). 
The password for the itch.io is ```webXR```.

The original project before improvements can be played [here](https://guanhuilim.github.io/csd3120-TeamProject/)

## 📃Brief

In this team project, we decide to go ahead and continue developing and testing immersion from Guan Hui’s previous IPA-B. This experience gives the player a virtual sword and the ability to cut objects being thrown at you into smaller pieces. We realized the potential that this simple mechanic has and decided to enhance this particular experience through various techniques based on our understanding that we’ve learnt from class and validate our findings through user evaluation.

The Application is currently developed using [Unity v2021.3.20f1(Long Term Support)](https://unity.com/releases/editor/whats-new/2021.3.20) together with [VRTK v4 Tilia Package Importer](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/vrtk-v4-tilia-package-importer-214936) package and [De-Panther’s WebXR Exporter](https://github.com/De-Panther/unity-webxr-export)

## 🛠️Building the Project

To Open and test the project yourself directly (without going to the website), make sure to download [Unity v2021.3.20f1(Long Term Support)](https://unity.com/releases/editor/whats-new/2021.3.20) using UnityHub. After launching Unity, locate the this root git directory as the project directory to open it and you should be able to see the project up and running.

A few steps addition set-up steps might be required and a video tutorial can be found on setting up and export the app yourself

If you’d like to test it out yourself.

**NOTE** We’d strongly recommend just using the hosted itch.io site to test as there are potential bugs from building it yourself.

## 🕹️VR Controls

Using the Meta-Quest 2 as the targetted device, below are the control scheme for the program.

**Note** Other devices should be supported but the mapping of the buttons *might be different*!

***Movement(Locomotion)*** 
- `Left Thumbstick` to move 
- `Right Thumbstick` press down to aim and release to Teleport to location (Teleport)

***Interactions*** 
- `Left/Right Grip button` Hold down to interact and pick up and hold onto the katana sword 
- `SWING while holding Grip button`Swing the katana while its in your hands to slash the surrounding objects that are shot at you. 
- `Hold down Left and Right Trigger button`Activates Blade Mode, in this mode time is drastically slowed down.

## 📁Directories

This Project’s root directory contains all folders required for Unity to load and open the project for editing.

Majority of the custom work such as assets, prefabs, textures, models etc can be found in the the `Assets` directory The unity scene of our interest is located currently at `Assets\LSamples\WebXR Interactions\0.16.3-preview\Sample Scene\Scenes\Desert.unity`
