# TP Feedback for Team 15
                                        
**TP Grade**: A+
                                        
## Immersion Design
articulated design that targets specific user experiences that relates well to immersion concepts
                                        
## Immersion Implementation
implementation is clearly related to immersion design and works well
                                        
## Evaluation Method
appropriate data collection method was performed with good quantity and/or quality
                                        
## Evaluation Analysis
data was thoroughly and meticulously analysed to form conclusions leading to a meaningful articulation of future work
                                        
## Documentation
a comprehensive README (clear/detailed instructions and architecture) and a well-made video demo (well-scripted articulations with good footages)
                                        
## Software Engineering
minimal evidence of properly managed software development processes as a team
                                        
## Other feedback
Good demonstration of immersion concepts in the design. Good articulation of how implementation relates to design as well.

Good application of methods to collect data based on concepts learned in class, but did not mention why the large differences to VRSQ in your custom quesitons. A decent attempt to analyze the data and really commendable effort to iterate on the feedback and do a post-evaluation. Slight pity that the post-evaluation analysis did not refer to the data to make discussions on how the new implementations relate to what aspects of improved experiences based on the evidence in the data.

Documentation - README is just ok as architecture is overly brief. Video was well-scripted, well-voiced and decently edited.
Software Engineering - no evidence of software processes provided other than high level role assignments and minimal task distribution seen in the different branches.
